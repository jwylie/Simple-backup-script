# Simple backup script
Designed to be ran in the command line by running the script for example:
  py backup.py
Path names need to be entered into script variables so that this script will run.

Running this script will zip specified directories and place the zipped file into a specific directory designed to hold backups

Note: Although no known errors exist with this script I do not recommend running this as your main backup technique, for example, I use this script as my third backup system, with two automatic cloud storage backup applications as my main backup systems.  But in order to keep localised backups I will run this script every few weeks
